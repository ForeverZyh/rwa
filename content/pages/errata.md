Title: Errata
Author: Panos Louridas

Errata do exist in the book; a detailed list can be found in the file
below. The file tries to be as comprehensive as possible. That means
that it includes *everything* that could be improved, but which the
author discovered after the book had hit the press. So, if the list
looks long, have in mind that it contains all sorts of amendments,
from changes in typography to downright bugs.

The inspiration for the format of the errata list is of course the
files maintained by
[Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/) for
[The Art of Computer Programming](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html)&mdash;indeed,
the layout and the typography are borrowed from them. Along with this
acknowledgment, many thanks from the author to Donald Knuth for his
books that provided many pleasant evenings.
