Title: Slides
Author: Panos Louridas

A full set of slides is available from the
[publisher](https://mitpress.mit.edu/txbkreq/328662), one deck per
chapter. The slides contain all the figures and the algorithms in the book, as
well as a lot of textual material. Anybody who is serious about making
presentations is familiar with the work of
[Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte):

  * slides should contain information-rich graphics
  * slides should not contain lots of text
  * bullets are evil

The book's slides do contain lots of graphics to explain how
algorithms work, so they are fine by the first requirement. However,
they are guilty for the next two. The reason is this: the slides can
be used for self-study, as well as for presentation purposes. So, they
contain enough text to create summaries of the chapters. They cannot
substitute reading the book, but they may be useful in showing some
salient points.

Be it as it may, the slides are in PDF format with scalable, vector
graphics. So it is not difficult to create subsets of them with, say,
graphic-rich content for use in a classroom, keeping the complete set
for home use.
